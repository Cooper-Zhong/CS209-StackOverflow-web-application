Project Spring Boot MVC/REST app.</p>\n<p>I would like to retain the flexibility to be able to create multiple implementations of Service and have list return a list of objects, depending on what the implementation requires.</p>\n<p>I appreciate I could create some inheritance/implementation hierarchy to define the kinds of objects of which T could encompass. My problem with both of those answers is that some use cases for Service involve me needing to return Lists of Java Standard Lib types - types I would rather not inherit/extend/implement for my own custom classes, which I would prefer be kept as lean as possible.</p>\n<pre><code>import java.util.List;\n\ninterface Service {\n    &lt;T&gt; List&lt;T&gt; list(String location, MyEnums.mediaType type );\n}\n\nclass MyEnums {\n    enum mediaType {\n        IMAGE, VIDEO, AUDIO\n    }\n}\n\nclass LocalService implements Service {\n    public List&lt;MyConcreteClass&gt; list(String location, MyEnums.mediaType type ) {\n        List&lt;MyConcreteClass&gt; list = null;\n        list.add(new MyConcreteClass(1, &quot;foo&quot;, new byte[0]));\n        return list;\n    }\n}\n\nclass MyConcreteClass implements Comparable&lt;MyConcreteClass&gt; {\n\n    private final long id;\n    private final String name;\n    private final byte[] data;\n\n    public MyConcreteClass(long id, String name, byte[] data) {\n        this.id = id;\n        this.name = name;\n        this.data = data;\n    }\n\n\n    @Override\n    public int compareTo(MyConcreteClass o) {\n        return this.name.compareTo(o.name);\n    }\n\n    // Other methods omitted for brevity\n}\n\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above code is only a simplified example of the actual app code - which compiles and runs without any (known) runtime bugs. However I get the compiler warning:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Unchecked overriding: return type requires unchecked conversion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The presence of a warning makes sense to me - code consuming the Service interface/API could break at runtime if the return type requirement in the calling code is incompatible with the implementation, whereas the error would be caught at compile if I had a more specific List&lt;&gt; defined in the interface.</p>\n<p>This would, of course, not be an issue if I had to wire in a concrete implementation into the code consuming my service - however the joys of Spring!</p>\n<p><strong>What am I doing wrong?

Are generics the right way to achieve a polymorphic list() function in my case?</strong></p>\n","question_id":73376182,"tags":["java","generics","polymorphism"],"score":-1,"accepted_answer_id":73377291,"is_answered":true,"view_count":81,"last_edit_date":1660666967},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/14e71d13a04b8caaba5669e7b71d8ca6?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG&f=y&so-version=2","account_id":10081294,"user_type":"registered","user_id":7451484,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7451484/mai65","reputation":93,"display_name":"Mai65"},"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73363223/use-compareto-on-more-specific-comparables-in-java","last_activity_date":1660587123,"creation_date":1660577664,"answer_count":1,"title":"use compareTo on more specific Comparables in Java","body":"<p>I would like to have a more specific Comparable interface so that I can type return parameters better.

The question on how to tackle this specific problem still persists. (adding a method to the <code>Message&lt;T&gt;</code> class that returns <code>Class&lt;Message&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>, perhaps?)</p>\n<p>Original question:</p>\n<p>So basically I have a generic <code>Message&lt;T&gt;</code> class that implements a well known design pattern called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Command pattern</a> (with a twist: instead of building an object with a reference, the reference is passed as argument of the <code>execute(T objectToCallMethodsOn)</code>) and it looks something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>public abstract class Message&lt;T&gt; {\n    void execute(T obj); //e.g. DoSomethingOnFooMessage implements Message&lt;Foo&gt; to do something on a Foo object\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>so that I can do something like:</p>\n<pre><code>public DoSomethingOnFooMessage implements Message&lt;Foo&gt; {\n    @Override\n    void execute(Foo obj) {\n        obj.doSomething(); //doSomething is a method of the Foo class\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, I also tried to make a MessageProcessor class with an internal map that maps (E is a type parameter) <code>Class&lt;Message&lt;E&gt;&gt;</code> to a object <code>E executableObject</code> (like Foo in the previous example) and with two methods: a handleMessage(Message&lt;?&gt; msg) that should do a dynamic instanceof of the Message (hence the need for the Class&lt;&gt; objects that let you do a dynamic instanceof and then a dynamic cast) and look for the right executableObject in the map to call the message's <code>execute(E obj)</code> on the right object (if it exists, otherwise the message is discarded), and a <code>addProcessor()</code> to add entries of e.g. <code>Class&lt;Message&lt;Foo&gt;&gt;, Foo</code> to the map:</p>\n<pre><code>public class MessageProcessor {\n    private final Map&lt;Class&lt;Message&lt;?&gt;&gt;, Object&gt; map;\n\n    public MessageProcessor() {\n        map = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\n    }\n\n    public &lt;E&gt; void addProcessor(Class&lt;Message&lt;E&gt;&gt; messageClass, E executable) {\n        map.put(messageClass, executable);\n    }\n    ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>So far that's what I wrote but the IDE complains that <code>Class&lt;Message&lt;E&gt;&gt;</code> was given but <code>Class&lt;Message&lt;?&gt;&gt;</code> was needed in <code>addProcessor()</code> and I don't know why; afaik, <code>SomeClass&lt;?&gt;</code> should be a superclass of any <code>SomeClass&lt;SpecificClass&gt;</code>, why isn't it the same for <code>Class&lt;SomeObject&lt;?&gt;&gt;</code> and <code>Class&lt;SomeObject&lt;SpecificObject&gt;&gt;</code>?</p>\n<p>Sorry for the verbose question, other than asking a thing about superclassing of generics, I am also asking you guys for (perhaps) a different, more elegant way to do what I'm trying to do, which is find the runtime class of the message so that I can call its <code>execute()</code> with the object that I registered with the <code>addProcessor()</code> as its input.</p>\n<p>Also, I reckon this could be easily solvable with raw types (ew)</p>\n","question_id":68022998,"tags":["java","generics"],"score":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":41,"last_edit_date":1623949628},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7686280776045b6d5250c0762c92ffd5?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG","account_id":135067,"user_type":"registered","user_id":337621,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/337621/g%c3%a1bor-lipt%c3%a1k","reputation":9676,"display_name":"G&#225;bor Lipt&#225;k","accept_rate":70},"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68014704/arraylist-does-not-satisfy-generic-serializable-list-type","last_activity_date":1623918736,"creation_date":1623914643,"answer_count":1,"title":"ArrayList does not satisfy generic serializable list type","body":"<p>Given the following java code:</p>\n<pre><code>public static &lt;I extends Serializable, L extends List&lt;I&gt; &amp; Serializable&gt; L getList() {\n    return new ArrayList&lt;I&gt;(); // &lt;-- Compile error\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Given that <code>ArrayList</code> do extend both <code>Serializable</code> and <code>List</code>, why does it produce a compile error?</p>\n<p><code>Incompatible types.

In short: <code>eq?</code> tests references, <code>eqv?</code> tests values and <code>equal?</code> recursively tests the values of lists. I would like to write a Java generic which needs the functionality of Scheme´s <code>equal?</code>.</p>\n\n<p>I tried to use Java´s <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#equals%28java.lang.Object%29\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">equals()</a> method, because I thought it does a value comparison, because for a reference comparison the <code>==</code> operator exists and there is no need for <code>equals</code> to do the same. But this assumption is completely wrong, because <code>equals</code> in Java is completely unreliable. Sometimes it does a value comparison and sometimes it does a reference comparison. And one can not be sure which class does a reference comparison and which class does a value comparison.</p>\n\n<p>This means that <code>equals</code> can not be used in a generic, because the generic would not do the same for all types. And it is also not possible to restrict the generic type in a way that only types are acceptable which implement the correct value comparison.</p>\n\n<p>So the question is: how to do a reliable value comparison in a generic? Do I have to write it on my own from scratch?</p>\n\n<p>By the way: I think Java´s equal failure does not start with <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/8777266/402322\">Array</a>. It starts already with Object. I think it is wrong that <code>equals</code> for two objects returns <code>false</code>. It must return <code>true</code>, because if you do a value comparison of something which does not have a value the values can not differ and therefor they must be the same. Scheme does it in that way and it is perfectly reasonable: <code>(equal?

Maybe this will help people restructure their code if they run into the same problem.<br />\nI wrote a class for my own datatype &quot;Polynom&quot; (mostly for practice and fun) with a couple of methods (add, multiply, divide, etc.). It is mainly based on a coefficient-list of doubles. Now, I wanted to change it, so a generic datatype could be used. I implemented an abstract class with all the required methods (adding, comparing, multiplying, calculating inverse, etc.). One of these is, that the datatype has a &quot;neutral element&quot;, an element which has no effect on addition/multiplication. For example, if you implement real numbers, the neutral element should be 1 and 0. And this was the point I struggled with. At the moment I implemented the neural Element as a parameter for the polynomial-class, but I want to write other datatypes which also use generics and don't want to add them every time as parameter since they don't really belong there. I hope this was somewhat understandable, I'm happy to update the question further if it isn't.</p>\n","question_id":65548166,"tags":["java","generics","abstract-class"],"score":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":308,"last_edit_date":1609686639},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2006365462920236/picture?type=large","account_id":13055145,"user_type":"registered","user_id":9434244,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9434244/martin-clever","reputation":147,"display_name":"Martin Clever"},"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65541924/how-can-a-generic-type-within-a-generic-type-be-accessed","last_activity_date":1609665056,"creation_date":1609607969,"answer_count":1,"title":"How can a generic type within a generic type be accessed?","body":"<p>Say I have an abstract class A</p>\n<pre><code>public abstract class A&lt;T extends SomeClass, R extends SomeClass&gt; {\n...\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And I have another class B</p>\n<pre><code>public class B&lt;S extends A&gt; {\n...\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>How can I access T and R within B?\nWhen I try</p>\n<pre><code>public class B&lt;F,G,S extends A&lt;F,G&gt;&gt; {\n</code></pre>\n<p>It gives the Error</p>\n<pre><code>error: type argument K#1 is not within bounds of type-variable K#2\npublic class B&lt;F,G,S extends A&lt;F,G&gt;&gt; {\n                                    ^\nwhere K#1,K#2 are type-variables:\nK#1 extends Object declared in class B\nK#2 extends SomeClass declared in class A\n</code></pre>\n","question_id":65541924,"tags":["java","generics","extends"],"score":0,"accepted_answer_id":65548194,"is_answered":true,"view_count":66,"last_edit_date":1609608738},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8f8f46ffe77e26a50b157c6aad9201f9?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG","account_id":1684128,"user_type":"registered","user_id":2103678,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2103678/skiaddict1","reputation":525,"display_name":"skiaddict1","accept_rate":83},"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64888934/java-generics-how-to-solve-warning-on-call-to-jcombobox-setrenderer","last_activity_date":1609634511,"creation_date":1605685409,"answer_count":1,"title":"Java Generics: how to solve warning on call to JComboBox.setRenderer","body":"<p>Coming back to Java after a multi-year hiatus, and partway through adding some code to an inhouse library.

For my thing, I can also explicitly override method &quot;isEquals&quot; to take specific primitive types. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>    public static &lt;F&gt; Predicate&lt;F&gt; isEquals(\n            ToIntFunction&lt;F&gt; aInMapFunction, int aInExpectedValue)\n    {\n        return aInActual -&gt;\n                aInMapFunction.applyAsInt(aInActual) == aInExpectedValue;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>This works fine, this method is invoked rather than the Object one when I pass in a method that returns a primitive int. The problem is that I still need the Object method, I cannot remove it, which will still cause the compiler to accept the weird invocation I listed above.</p>\n<p>So the question is: is there a way for me to tell Java to not use the Object version of isEquals when the method reference returns a primitive type? I couldn't find anything, I'm feeling I'm out of luck in this one.</p>\n<p>(NOTE: the actual implementation of the object version of isEquals works fine and should be safe. This is because Object.equals and Object<strong>s</strong>.equals accept Object parameters and a String object will never be equals to an Integer object. Semantically, however, this looks weird)</p>\n<p>EDIT: after the comment from &quot;paranoidAndroid&quot;, one idea that I just had is to wrap the method reference the following way:</p>\n<pre><code>    public static &lt;T&gt; Function&lt;T, Integer&gt; wrap(ToIntFunction&lt;T&gt; aInFunction)\n    {\n        return aInFunction::applyAsInt;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>And now,</p>\n<pre><code>Predicate&lt;String&gt; lLengthIs20 = isEquals(wrap(String::length), &quot;what the heck?!?!?&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n<p>... generates a compilation error. Still not great though, maybe there is a better way. At least this is better than passing the type in explicitly, which kind of beats the purpose.</p>\n<p>EDIT 2: I'm in Java 8 right now. Java 11 might behave differently here, I didn't test.</p>\n<p>EDIT 3: I'm thinking there is nothing we can do here, this is just an implication of how type inference works in Java. Here is another example:</p>\n<pre><code>    public static &lt;T&gt; boolean isEquals(T t1, T t2) {\n        return Objects.equals(t1, t2);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>with this method, the following expression is perfectly valid:</p>\n<pre><code>System.out.println(isEquals(10, &quot;20&quot;));\n</code></pre>\n<p>This works because Java will try to resolve the type for T based on a common upper bound. It just happens that both Integer and String share the same upper bound <code>Serializable &amp; Comparable&lt;? extends Serializable &amp; Comparable&lt;?&gt;&gt;</code></p>\n","question_id":63384914,"tags":["java","generics","type-inference"],"score":8,"is_answered":true,"view_count":585,"last_edit_date":1597361783},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Mo0at.jpg?s=256&g=1","account_id":1135699,"user_type":"registered","user_id":1120793,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1120793/darshan-mehta","reputation":30287,"display_name":"Darshan Mehta","accept_rate":35},"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63411281/convert-generic-types-to-objects","last_activity_date":1597411987,"creation_date":1597402005,"answer_count":2,"title":"Convert Generic Types to Objects","body":"<p>I am writing a transformer to convert <code>String</code> input to output of custom type.

But that doesn't work, because the Thread is blocked.</li>\n<li>I've seen other answers claiming that I want to close the stream that the <code>Scanner</code> is reading. But that doesn't seem to work either&mdash;<code>Scanner</code> docs indicate that its <code>close()</code> method closes the underlying stream, so that <em>should</em> be what I'm doing in the above toy code.</li>\n<li>I'd even be willing to use a deprecated method like <code>stop()</code>, but even that appears to have no effect.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Any ideas? Thanks.</p>\n\n<p>(If you're curious, the underlying motivation is to create an automated grader for my students' work. The stream will ultimately be the stdout of a process being executed by a thread. But some of my students will have infinite loops, and I want the thread to terminate after <em>n</em> seconds, even if the process hasn't completed.

Maybe the IP string looks like <code>/192.168.1.2</code> \nThe server should interprete it and start the sound by streaming. </p>\n\n<pre><code>private void playSound (String soundFileName) {\n        Uri myUri1 = Uri.parse(\"file:/\" + _clientIP + soundFileName);\n        _txtHint.setText(myUri1.toString());\n\n        mPlayer = new MediaPlayer();\n        mPlayer.setAudioStreamType(AudioManager.STREAM_MUSIC);\n        try {\n            mPlayer.setDataSource(getApplicationContext(), myUri1);\n        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {\n            Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), \"You might not set the URI correctly!\", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();\n        } catch (SecurityException e) {\n            Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), \"You might not set the URI correctly!\", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();\n        } catch (IllegalStateException e) {\n            Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), \"You might not set the URI correctly!\", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n        try {\n            mPlayer.prepare();\n        } catch (IllegalStateException e) {\n            Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), \"MISE: You might not set the URI correctly!\", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), \"MIOE: You might not set the URI correctly!\", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();\n        }\n        mPlayer.start();\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If I take a simple http URI it works very well (i.e. <a href=\"http://test.com/sound.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://test.com/sound.mp3</a>). The sound will be played. Now I am trying to play the sound the client sends to the server. But the code breaks with an IOException (\"Prepared failed: status 0x1\") at <code>mPlayer.prepare();</code> I believe the URI is wrong. I tried several ways (<code>rtsp://IP:port/path</code>, <code>rtsp://IP/path</code>, same with <code>file://</code> and <code>http://</code>). But I do not find the right one. Maybe I miss a thing? Do the server have permission to access the clients sound? If not, how do I give it to the server?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for your help!\nGreets, S-Man</p>\n\n<p>Edit1: ServerSocket</p>\n\n<pre><code>try {       \n     _serverSocket = new ServerSocket(SocketServerPORT);\n\n            while (true) {\n                socket = _serverSocket.accept();\n                dataInputStream = new DataInputStream(\n                        socket.getInputStream());\n                dataOutputStream = new DataOutputStream(\n                        socket.getOutputStream());\n\n                _message = dataInputStream.readUTF();\n                _clientIP = socket.getInetAddress().toString();\n\n                Server.this.runOnUiThread(new Runnable() {\n\n                    @Override\n                    public void run() {     \n                        //Here the Sound should be played.\n                        Server.this.playSound(_message);\n                    }\n                });\n\n                dataOutputStream.writeUTF(_message);\n      }\n} catch (IOException e) {...\n</code></pre>\n","question_id":25648397,"tags":["java","android","audio","stream","lan"],"score":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":1110,"last_edit_date":1409829290},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/PHEGc.png?s=256&g=1","account_id":4272295,"user_type":"registered","user_id":3493847,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3493847/tamas-g","reputation":687,"display_name":"Tamas G.","accept_rate":81},"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25606592/is-it-possible-to-return-more-than-one-value-from-a-servlet-to-client","last_activity_date":1409577690,"creation_date":1409576861,"answer_count":3,"title":"Is it possible to return more than one value from a servlet to client?","body":"<p>I have a servlet which generates a .png image and writes it into the <code>OutputStream</code> as a byte array. </p>\n\n<p>I'd like to create an application which fires that servlet and downloads the generated image.

It's a code I saw on the internet and modified a bit to suit my needs. Now the thing is, I'm basically sending a message from the client to the server. This message would be \"hello there\". The server checks port 6789 for a message that contains the word \"hello\" and if that's true, it has to get the names of all files/sub-directories in a certain directory. The first of these names is sent back to the client and the client prints it. I've opened port 6789 and sending the message from the client to the server works perfectly. The server receives it and executes the necessary action, but it won't send back the data to the client. I don't know whether the client isn't receiving it or whether the server isn't sending it.
