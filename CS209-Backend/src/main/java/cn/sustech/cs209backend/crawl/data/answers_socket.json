Within the Open Systems Interconnection (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OSI</a>) model, MAC addresses are used in the medium access control protocol sublayer of the data link layer.</p>\n\n<p>MAC addresses are most often assigned by the manufacturer of network interface cards. Each is stored in hardware, such as the card's read-only memory or by a firmware mechanism.</p>\n\n<p>Use the following function <strong><code>getPhysicalAddress()</code></strong> to get list of MAC address:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>static String format = \"%02X\"; // To get 2 char output.\nprivate static String[] getPhysicalAddress() throws Exception{\n    try {\n        // DHCP Enabled - InterfaceMetric\n        Set&lt;String&gt; macs = new LinkedHashSet&lt;String&gt;();\n\n        Enumeration&lt;NetworkInterface&gt; nis = NetworkInterface.getNetworkInterfaces();\n        while( nis.hasMoreElements() ) {\n            NetworkInterface ni = nis.nextElement();\n            byte mac [] = ni.getHardwareAddress(); // Physical Address (MAC - Medium Access Control)\n            if( mac != null ) {\n                final StringBuilder macAddress = new StringBuilder();\n                for (int i = 0; i &lt; mac.length; i++) {\n                    macAddress.append(String.format(\"%s\"+format, (i == 0) ?

The line with <code>bc</code> indicates start of a chunk of 188 bytes long (0xBC = 188).

It's basically an extremely basic socket which is in the request header pretending to be a HTTP 1.1 client.</p>\n\n<p>If it's not affordable to rewrite the client in such way that it can deal with it (at least try pretending as a HTTP 1.0 client), or to switch to a real 1.1 HTTP aware client (in Java terms, that would be e.g. <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2793150/using-java-net-urlconnection-to-fire-and-handle-http-requests/\"><code>URLConnection</code></a>), then rewrite your servlet in such way that it sets the content length.</p>\n\n<pre><code>@Override\npublic void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {\n    // ...\n    String xmlDoc = getXML();\n    byte[] content = xmlDoc.getBytes(\"UTF-8\");\n\n    response.setContentType(\"text/xml\");\n    response.setCharacterEncoding(\"UTF-8\");\n    response.setContentLengthLong(content.length);\n    response.getOutputStream().write(content);\n}   \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you're not on Java EE 7 / Servlet 3.1 <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/ServletResponse.html#setContentLengthLong-long-\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">yet</a>, and you can guarantee that the XML content is not larger than <code>Integer.MAX_VALUE</code> (2GB), then use</p>\n\n<pre><code>    response.setContentLength((int) content.length);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or if you can't guarantee that, then use</p>\n\n<pre><code>    response.setHeader(\"Content-Length\", String.valueOf(content.length));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that it must represent the byte length and thus certainly not the character (string) length. Also note that you don't need a try-with-resources statement.

The TCP stack implementation will handle the packet loss problems you mention, and throw an error/exception if it can't fix it by itself. Its responsibility is the communication with the remote TCP stack. Since in most cases you want your application to talk to a remote application, there needs to be an extra acknowledgement on top of that. In general, the application protocol needs to be designed to handle these cases.
