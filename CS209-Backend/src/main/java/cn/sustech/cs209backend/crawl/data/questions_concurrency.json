What is the reason for this?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/PHOWJ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">enter image description here</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/v5CzM.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">enter image description here</a></p>\n<p><div class=\"snippet\" data-lang=\"js\" data-hide=\"false\" data-console=\"true\" data-babel=\"false\">\r\n<div class=\"snippet-code\">\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>@Slf4j\npublic class Test08Park4 {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException{\n\n        Thread t1 = new Thread(new Runnable() {\n            @Override\n            public void run() {\n                LockSupport.park();\n                /**\n                 * With this log print, locksupport.park () cannot stop threads;\n                 * If you comment this out, locksupport.park () can stop the thread\n                 */\n                log.debug(\"test.......\");\n                Thread.interrupted();\n                LockSupport.park();\n                log.debug(\"finished...\");\n            }\n        });\n        t1.start();\n        sleep(1000);\n        t1.interrupt();\n    }\n}</code></pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\nif do not comment [log.debug(&quot;test.......&quot;)] out,the result:</p>\n<p><div class=\"snippet\" data-lang=\"js\" data-hide=\"false\" data-console=\"true\" data-babel=\"false\">\r\n<div class=\"snippet-code\">\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>22:37:05.435 [Thread-0] DEBUG test.Test08Park4 - test.......\n22:37:05.439 [Thread-0] DEBUG test.Test08Park4 - finished...</code></pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\nif comment [log.debug(&quot;test.......&quot;)] out,the result:</p>\n<p>//nothing</p>\n\n","question_id":73975470,"tags":["java","multithreading"],"score":0,"accepted_answer_id":73975752,"is_answered":true,"view_count":93,"last_edit_date":1665068182},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f947ba0438d76ee69a779510f60a1a56?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG","account_id":16231683,"user_type":"registered","user_id":11720290,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11720290/bananasmoothii","reputation":144,"display_name":"Bananasmoothii"},"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73973632/how-to-fire-and-forget-with-kotlin-coroutines-in-a-blocking-event","last_activity_date":1665061342,"creation_date":1665058524,"answer_count":1,"title":"How to &quot;fire and forget&quot; with kotlin coroutines in a blocking event?","body":"<p>I am making something similar to minecraft plugin, but the API is all in Java.</p>\n<p>At some point, there are events.

When I call <code> clientSocket= serverSocket.Accept();</code> everything in my app stops, i use a switcher to call the method that has the above line, the switcher shows like its turning on but hangs due to a method that imolements a blocking call till a bluetooth device connects to the socket. How can I avoid that effect on the main thread of my app because I believe once a bluetooth device connects to the app then the blocking call will be removed and the switcher will resume to being checked.

Currently I have a large number of files(200+) that are being generated and I am using Spring Batch to transfer the files where each step maps to 1 file.\nEverything about the job is dynamic, as in the number of steps and each step's reader and writer is distinct to that step. So no step shares readers or writers. There is a thread pool dedicated to running the steps concurrently, and then each step has its own thread pool so we can do parallelism per step. When combined with commit interval this gives great throughput and control.</p>\n<p>So my questions are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How can I change the number of running steps after the Job has started?</li>\n<li>How can I change the commit interval after a step has started processing?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So lets consider an example of why I would like to do this and what exactly I mean by change &quot;running steps&quot; and &quot;commit interval&quot;.</p>\n<p>Consider the case you have a total of 300 steps to process with a step thread pool size 5. I begin processing and realize that I have more resources to utilize, I would like to change the thread count to say 8.\nWhen I actually do this at run-time what I experience is that the thread pool does increase but the number of running steps does not change. Why is that?</p>\n<p>Following a similar logic say I have more memory to utilize, I would then like to increase my commit interval at run-time. I have not found anything in the StepExecution class that would let me change the commit interval surprisingly. Why not?</p>\n<p>What is interesting is that for parallelism I am able to change the number of running threads by simply increasing that thread pool's size. From simply changing the number of parallel threads I noticed massive increase in throughput.</p>\n<p>If you would like more information I can provide code, and link to the repository.</p>\n<p>Thank you very much.</p>\n","question_id":72567117,"tags":["java","spring","multithreading","spring-batch"],"score":1,"accepted_answer_id":72570061,"is_answered":true,"view_count":275},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9e9ee1e1f1b74a7909d5b65d0626f6ea?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG&f=y&so-version=2","account_id":16264338,"user_type":"registered","user_id":11744870,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11744870/blueryse","reputation":29,"display_name":"BlueRyse"},"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72547510/threads-logic-in-java","last_activity_date":1654778339,"creation_date":1654698502,"answer_count":1,"title":"Threads logic in Java","body":"<p>I'm trying to resolve a university exercise.

option, but does not hold up much:</p>\n<p>The first alternative is &quot;safer&quot; precisely because it is SLOWER, so it has MORE time to identify contention at the end of the current of incoming threads.</p>\n<p>BUT is not even 100% safe because of the &quot;happens once&quot; thing that is impossible to ensure.</p>\n<p>There is also a behavior with the code, that, when it reaches the end of a <strong>continuos flow</strong> of incoming threads, 2 signals are dispatched one after the other, the second to last one, and then the last one.</p>\n<p>But IF it is safer because it is slower, wouldn't that defeat the goal of using atomics, since their usage is supposed to be with the aim of being a better performance alternative in the first place?</p>\n","question_id":71325131,"tags":["java","multithreading","concurrency","atomic","compare-and-swap"],"score":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":111},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WDIU2.jpg?s=256&g=1","account_id":7280482,"user_type":"registered","user_id":5550425,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5550425/roman-horbovyi","reputation":75,"display_name":"Roman Horbovyi"},"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71212008/can-another-thread-see-an-effectively-immutable-object-in-an-inconsistent-state","last_activity_date":1646233694,"creation_date":1645471877,"answer_count":3,"title":"Can another thread see an effectively immutable object in an inconsistent state if it is published with a volatile reference?","body":"<p>According to Java Concurrency in Action if we have the following class:</p>\n<pre><code>public class Wrapper {\n  private int num;\n\n  public Wrapper(int num) {\n    this.num = num;\n  }\n\n  public void assertCorrectness() {\n    if (num != num)\n      throw new AssertionError(&quot;This is false&quot;);\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>and we initialise an instance of this class and publish it in a non-safe way (through a simple public field for example), then the assertCorrectness() might indeed throw an AssertionError, if called from another thread.

The video files range in size from a few megs to 20 GB or more. This means downloading a file can take as little as a few seconds to as much as a few hours. I've decided to implement a produce/consumer pattern to handle the scraping and downloading of files. A producer thread scrapes the site and retrieves the links to the video files and puts those links into an object and puts that object into an unbounded blocking queue. There are N consumer threads that handle the download. They retrieve the objects containing the URLs from the blocking queue and each thread downloads the file. The object that the producer puts on the queue contains the URL along with some other information that the consumer will need to save the file to the correct location in local storage. Before a file is downloaded, the consumer thread first checks if the file already exists in local storage. If the file exists, the download is skipped and the next object is pulled from the queue. If a consumer experiences a problem while downloading a file (connection reset, etc.), the consumer puts the object containing the URL into a separate queue for failed requests and sleeps for 15 minutes. This allows the application to deal with temporary network interruptions. While the producer is active, it checks the failed URLs queue and removes those URLs from that queue and puts them back into the main queue.</p>\n<p>After implementing this initial design, I quickly realized that I had a problem. Because I'm using a blocking queue and the worker threads are polling without a timeout, once the producer was finished, it couldn't just complete its execution because it needed to hang around to put failed URLs back into the queue. My first attempt at a solution was to remove the second &quot;failure&quot; queue and have workers put failed URLs back into the main queue. This meant that the application now had N consumers and N + 1 producers. This approach would allow the main producer thread to just exit when it was finished because it didn't have to worry about putting failed requests back into the queue. Once that problem was solved, there was still another problem. The problem of notifying the worker threads that they could exit once the queue was empty. A blocking queue has no mechanism for the producer to signal that it won't be putting more data to the queue. I thought about having the consumers poll the queue with a timeout and have the primary producer set some sort of flag when it exits. When a consumer times out, it checks the flag. If the flag is set, the consumer exits, if not set, it polls the queue again. While this approach will work, I don't like the design. I don't like the idea of having threads sitting around unnecessarily and I hate even more the use of a magic flag. The only interaction between producer and consumers should be via the queue. The consumers have no knowledge of the producer and checking a magic flag breaks that principle.</p>\n<p>I ditched the blocking queue and decided to use a regular non-blocking queue. To prevent the worker threads from exiting as soon as they started, I used a <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CyclicBarrier.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">CyclicBarrier</a>. When a worker thread starts, it waits at the barrier before polling the queue. Meanwhile, the producer thread was coded to lower the barrier once the queue contained 10 x N URLs. Once the barrier was lowered, the worker threads would begin processing the Queue. This approach quickly failed because in some cases the consumers would consume the queue faster than the producer could replenish it. This happens in cases where a large number of files are already stored on disk so the consumers don't need to download anything. Once the queue was empty, the consumers exited, even though the producer was still scraping the site looking for URLs.</p>\n<p>This tells me that I need to use a blocking queue. I'm continuing to try to find a clean, elegant solution that doesn't depend on timeouts and magic flags. I would love to hear your approach to solving this problem given the requirements.</p>\n<p>UPDATE:\nI finally settled on a solution based on comments made by user Martin James. Since these were comments and not an answer, there isn't an answer for me to accept. If Martin summarizes his comments into an answer, I'll accept it. Now here's the solution.</p>\n<p>When the producer thread completes, it places N objects into the queue that contain <code>null</code> as the value for the URL. I updated the consumer thread to check for a <code>null</code> URL when they pull an object from the queue. If the URL is <code>null</code>, the consumer exits. This approach solves the notification to consumers that the producer is complete. However, it doesn't solve the problem of consumers putting URLs into the queue after the producer has exited. To solve that problem, I switched to a priority blocking queue. I made the object that gets put into the queue a <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Comparable</a> and the <code>compareTo</code> logic was coded such that objects with <code>null</code> values for the URL will always be last in the queue. So when the producer exits and it places the terminating objects in the queue, if/when a consumer places an object back into the queue, those objects will always be ahead of the terminating objects.</p>\n<p>Thanks all for the comments and feedback. Very much appreciated.</p>\n","question_id":69950945,"tags":["java","multithreading","queue"],"score":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":378,"last_edit_date":1636812716},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0105d720803ed2616466c6d825ec2ae9?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG&f=y&so-version=2","account_id":4475927,"user_type":"registered","user_id":3641058,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3641058/learning-developer","reputation":52,"display_name":"Learning Developer"},"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68802148/completeablefuture-for-a-large-dataset","last_activity_date":1629125145,"creation_date":1629113822,"answer_count":0,"title":"CompleteableFuture for a large dataset","body":"<p>I have multi-threaded Spring Boot application in which I am reading data from table in batches (the table contains around 1 million records).</p>\n<p>I am getting into Java heap memory issues, and I am unable to find a workaround.

To make things concrete, let's say I can allocate 30GB for the heap and that each task requires on average about 3GB of memory at its peak, but with some variability both over time and from task to task. A few tasks here and there might even require 6GB.</p>\n<p>In this case, it seems more efficient to try to run 10 (or arguably even more) tasks concurrently, and if / when we bump into the memory limit have the task wait, much the same as we do with other shared resources like I/O, specific memory addresses (which are accessed through locks), etc.</p>\n<p>Is it possible do this in Java?

Also, I guess treating all memory requests as equal can lead to deadlocks. So I want to emphasize that here we are talking about only about 10 tasks, and the desire to &quot;max out&quot; the memory usage seems like a very natural one. I do not mind wrapping my tasks by some suitable logic that will distinguish their memory requests as having lower priority.

My real example is different from this, but I believe the idea is the same.</p>\n","question_id":68786081,"tags":["java","multithreading"],"score":-2,"accepted_answer_id":68786399,"closed_reason":"Needs details or clarity","is_answered":true,"view_count":80},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kZ6I3Z1pZR4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AKxrwcb_NhR3Q7JgAnrbJvIajAMxUXMGTg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=256","account_id":15183229,"user_type":"registered","user_id":10955997,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10955997/siddharth-teli","reputation":107,"display_name":"Siddharth Teli"},"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61711333/reading-from-writing-to-network-stream-simultaneously","last_activity_date":1628970832,"creation_date":1589110674,"answer_count":0,"title":"Reading from &amp; writing to network stream simultaneously","body":"<pre><code>public class twowaychat {\n\n    ServerSocket server;\n    Socket socket;\n    BufferedReader read;\n    BufferedWriter write;\n    String temp, temp1;\n\n    twowaychat() {\n\n        Thread thread1 = new Thread(&quot;Read-Client&quot;) {\n\n            public void run() {\n                try {\n                    do {\n\n                        temp = read.readLine();\n\n                        System.out.print(temp);\n                    } while (!(temp.equals(&quot;Exit&quot;)));\n                    close();\n                } catch (Exception e) {\n                    System.out.print(&quot;Line 30 error     :&quot; + e.toString());\n                }\n\n            }\n        };\n        Thread thread2 = new Thread(&quot;Write-Client&quot;) {\n            public void run() {\n                try {\n                    Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n                    do {\n                        temp1 = scan.next();\n                        write.write(temp1);\n\n                    } while (!(temp.equals(&quot;Exit&quot;)));\n                    close();\n                } catch (Exception e) {\n                    System.out.print(&quot;Line 53 error     :&quot; + e.toString());\n                }\n            }\n        };\n        try {\n\n            server = new ServerSocket(4368);\n            socket = server.accept();\n            System.out.println(&quot;Connected &quot;);\n            read = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\n            write = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(socket.getOutputStream()));\n\n            thread1.start();\n            thread2.start();\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            System.out.println(&quot;Line 72 error     :&quot; + e.toString());\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    protected void close() {\n        try {\n            System.out.print(&quot;Closing Connection&quot;);\n            read.close();\n            write.close();\n            socket.close();\n\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            System.out.print(e.toString());\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String args[]) {\n        twowaychat obj = new twowaychat();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I want to build a chatting program.

I learned that <code>CachedThreadPool</code>s and <code>FixedThreadPool</code>s operate almost in the same way, except <code>CachedThreadPool</code> doesn't have a thread limit and might re-use already initialized threads.

However, I am fairly lost when it comes to filling out the multiplybyThreads function.  I'm thinking that it should multiply the second matrix m and return the result matrix by using threads.  Also, I've already defined a run() function in the ColumnCalculator to use.  I'm also thinking that I should allocate 10 threads at a time, then wait for all 10 threads to complete to then initiate the next 10 threads.  I've also found that the thread.join() function may be useful for the waiting scheme. After all of this, like I said, I'm fairly lost so some help creating this function would be amazing.</p>\n","question_id":64140757,"tags":["java","multithreading","matrix"],"score":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":157},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d401b677f03e93a3766597a08ef9e098?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG&f=y&so-version=2","account_id":19098043,"user_type":"registered","user_id":13946904,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/13946904/jeb","reputation":447,"display_name":"Jeb"},"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64134839/how-to-call-a-method-with-multiple-threads","last_activity_date":1601465970,"creation_date":1601458775,"answer_count":2,"title":"how to call a method with multiple threads","body":"<p>I have a method <code>sendMail(list)</code>.

The problem is: The frame stays blank until the game finishes (loop through a certain number of generations) and then displays the last state of the cells. I used print statements and can see that the program runs correctly. The frame just doesn't display anything until the end.

I am wondering to what extent the general principals described in the book apply to .Net. I am not interested in rolling my own lock free code – I just want to use solid, understandable techniques and exploit existing synchronized and concurrent APIs. To that extent, the key takeaways from the book for me were:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Locking – states changes made inside a lock in one thread are visible to all other threads inside a locks on the same object. No doubt this works in .NET and would be sufficient to write thread safe programs but it leads to unnecessary locking if we cannot rely on the following mechanisms.</li>\n<li>Safe Publication – The latest state of an effectively immutable object (an object which is not changed after publication) is visible to all threads provided one of the following holds. Note that seeing the latest state of a reference to an object is not the necessarily same as seeing the latest state of the object itself – in Java safe publication works because of the transitive nature  of the happens-before relationship.\n<ul>\n<li>Access to it’s references are synchronized via locks in all threads</li>\n<li>It is referenced via a volatile variable  </li>\n<li>It is published from a synchronized or concurrent collection.\n<br/></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>The latest state of properly constructed immutable objects with only final fields (readonly in .NET) are thread safe regardless of how they are published.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I would hope all of these work otherwise it makes life unnecessarily difficult, but from what I have ready the model for .Net (at least as it is specified) is quite weak. Has anyone tried to construct a happens-before model for .NET? I think this an area which badly needs to be addressed in .Net. As far as I know there isn’t an equivalent book for .Net which can give the same ‘level of comfort’ – it seems that at least part of the problem is the lack of a well defined memory model for .NET.</p>\n","question_id":8707215,"tags":["java",".net","multithreading","concurrency"],"score":3,"accepted_answer_id":8966482,"is_answered":true,"view_count":272},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9a03c98f2758dd9307a5b114a5494604?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG&f=y&so-version=2","account_id":3990188,"user_type":"registered","user_id":3289405,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3289405/user3289405","reputation":137,"display_name":"user3289405"},"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56706833/how-to-create-expensivegraph","last_activity_date":1561901033,"creation_date":1561132598,"answer_count":1,"title":"How to create ExpensiveGraph","body":"<p>I want to use below code in my application</p>\n\n<pre><code>LoadingCache&lt;Key, Graph&gt; graphs = Caffeine.newBuilder()\n    .maximumSize(10_000)\n    .build(key -&gt; createExpensiveGraph(key));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But, I am so dumb in multithreading that I could not figure it out how do I implement the function createExpensiveGraph.\nPlease help.</p>\n","question_id":56706833,"tags":["java","multithreading","concurrency","caffeine"],"score":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":720,"last_edit_date":1561145487},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a5598ec79a68ad4279f3c65061c7e277?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG&f=y&so-version=2","account_id":11606331,"user_type":"registered","user_id":8501925,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8501925/fancypants753","reputation":429,"display_name":"Fancypants753","accept_rate":60},"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48124257/python-equivalent-of-concurrenthashmap-from-java","last_activity_date":1561844773,"creation_date":1515212775,"answer_count":1,"title":"Python equivalent of concurrentHashMap from Java?","body":"<p>I know that dictionaries are atomic in python but (correct me if I'm wrong) that means only a single addition to the dictionary can be completed at a time.

The web connections have NO control or authority over what is computed and when the computations execute - as I've said - this is being done in a pool in the background but these thread can publish when the computation has completed (how they do is the gist of this question). The publish message maybe consumed or not - depending if any subscribers are interested in this computed value.</p>\n\n<p>As these are web connections that will be blocking - i could potentially have 1000s of concurrent connections waiting (subscribing) for their specific computed value so such a solution needs to be very light on blocking resources.
