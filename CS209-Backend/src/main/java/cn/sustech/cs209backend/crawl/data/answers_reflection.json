Any exception may have left invalid state if it's not properly handled.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Different definitions.</p>\n<p>Normal exceptions (i.e. everything except InternalError and OOME) have well defined behaviour: Either the code (by executing the statement <code>throw someException;</code>), or the JVM itself (for example by executing <code>foo.instanceMethod</code> where <code>foo</code> resolves to <code>null</code>, causing the JVM to throw an NPE), throws an exception. That means at the point the exception is thrown, execution of that context stops and execution jumps to the relevant catch block, or if there is none, that method is aborted and the caller now gets this exception thrown, and so on.</p>\n<p>This does not cause invalid state unless you suck at programming. Unfortunately, a <em>ton</em> of SO answers and tutorials suck at programming, they do this:</p>\n<pre><code>try {\n  some code here;\n} catch (IOException e) {\n  e.printStackTrace();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>... which leaves code in an invalid state: The problem is, execution <strong>continues</strong> after that catch block, which is bad. The right way to write code that doesn't want to care about some exception is instead:</p>\n<pre><code>try {\n  some code here;\n} catch (IOException e) {\n  throw new RuntimeException(&quot;unhandled&quot;, e);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>That is merely ugly, vs the <code>e.printStackTrace()</code> version, which is downright broken. Update your IDE's templates!</p>\n<p>At any rate, <strong>that</strong> is what you mean here with 'undefined behaviour' - crappy code. You can say that about any code: Well, that code COULD have bugs, so, what does it do? No body knows! - yeah, okay, but take that argument to its logical conclusion and your only remaining option is to toss your computer out the window and go live with the amish.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the <code>java.*</code> classes and all well-written libraries (most commonly used libraries are well written in this sense) <strong>do not</strong> do the above - if they throw stuff, the behaviour is not 'undefined'. Generally, all operations are atomic: Either it works, or, it did absolutely nothing and instead threw an exception (vs the above crappy code which acts like it works, in the sense that the method returns normally, but there's a stack trace on your console and the method did not do what its javadoc says it should be doing).</p>\n<p>What the community means specifically when they say that OOME causes undefined behaviour is that OOME is a special snowflake, in this regard:</p>\n<p>OOME can occur 'within' otherwise protected execution contexts: Unlike almost any other exception, it can be thrown inside the innards of the JVM that aren't expecting to deal with exceptions, and thus, it leaves e.g. a file handle half-open and in an undefined fragile state (where interacting with that handle causes bizarre exceptions or worse, undefined behaviours), and so on.</p>\n<p>That's the difference. If, say, writing to an <code>OutputStream</code> you got from <code>Files.newOutputStream</code> causes some IOException, then behaviour is still well defined. Nothing changed in this record. Normally, given:</p>\n<pre><code>try (var out = Files.newOutputStream(.. path ..)) {\n  out.write(5);\n  out.write(11);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>At the <code>.write(5)</code> command, either [A] that returns normally at which point you know that the '5' is at the very least in the OS's core file caches (no longer in your JVM's file caches), or [B] it throws an IOException that will accurately represent the issue at hand.</p>\n<p>Let's say that <code>.write(5)</code> threw some exception, you caught it, and then you want to just continue to the <code>.write(11)</code> line. Nothing changed: You <em>STILL</em> have the same setup: Either that does work (let's say the exception was: You have no write access, and in the catch of that you prompt the user to fix it and sleep the thread for a while, and the user actually <code>sudo chmod</code> fixes it, then depending on how the OS and java works that might mean future <code>.write</code> calls will now work just fine!) - or most likely it won't, but you still get exceptions 'as expected': IOExceptions that properly describe the problem.</p>\n<p>In contrast to OOME: If <code>.write(5)</code> throw an OOM, then <code>.write(11)</code> may cause your computer to blast Beethoven's Ode to Joy from the speakers as far as you know - the system is in an unstable state and the OutputStream you have may now behave in ways that the javadoc do not cover.</p>\n<p>Note that this isn't universal. Not all OOMEs lead to an 'unstable' system. For example, this code is perfectly fine:</p>\n<pre><code>byte[] bigArray;\ntry {\n  bigArray = new byte[100000000];\n} catch (OutOfMemoryError e) {\n  // handle the fact that you can't make em that big\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Essentially, if any method invoke throws OOME you need to accept that various things can now be in a state that the javadoc do not describe and whose behaviour is dependent on all sorts of weird factors (OS, JVM vendor, java version, phase of the moon...), but a few primitives, mostly the <code>new arr[size]</code> operation, you know what happened and can reliably respond to the OOME.</p>\n","answer_id":72547035,"question_id":72546743},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c47d1f7544a8c4a1bb7a41d511f53604?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG","account_id":1580843,"user_type":"registered","user_id":1466267,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1466267/spacetrucker","reputation":13479,"display_name":"SpaceTrucker","accept_rate":91},"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","score":1,"is_accepted":false,"last_activity_date":1654696636,"creation_date":1654696636,"body":"<p>The problem with OOME is not that allocations for large memory chunks may fail, but that such allocations allocate everything thats available.

The first of these classes, Enumeration, was introduced in <code>JDK1.0</code> and is generally considered deprecated in favor of newer iteration classes, like Iterator and ListIterator. </p>\n\n<p>As with most programming languages, the Iterator class includes a <code>hasNext()</code> method that returns a boolean indicating if the iteration has anymore elements. If <code>hasNext()</code> returns <code>true</code>, then the <code>next()</code> method will return the next element in the iteration. Unlike Enumeration, Iterator also has a <code>remove()</code> method, which removes the last element that was obtained via <code>next()</code>. </p>\n\n<p>While Iterator is generalized for use with all collections in the <code>Java Collections Framework</code>, <code>ListIterator</code> is more specialized and only works with List-based collections, like <code>ArrayList</code>, <code>LinkedList</code>, and so forth. However, <code>ListIterator</code> adds even more functionality by allowing iteration to traverse in both directions via <code>hasPrevious()</code> and <code>previous()</code> methods.</p>\n","answer_id":56703665,"question_id":15398703,"last_edit_date":1561127402},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/564b38932e11a690bcb1304611275337?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG&f=y&so-version=2","account_id":15512994,"user_type":"registered","user_id":11191320,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11191320/jayswal-mihir","reputation":1,"display_name":"Jayswal Mihir"},"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","score":0,"is_accepted":false,"last_activity_date":1552398656,"creation_date":1552398656,"body":"<pre><code>public class Main\n{\n    public static void main(String args[])\n    {\n        int a=10;\n        try\n        {\n            System.out.println(a/0);

One might want to remove the 'final' modifier to extend the class during runtime by using 'ASM' or libraries like 'byte-buddy'. I agree that if it is a final class, it is probably for a good reason but custom business logic may require to do so.  </p>\n","answer_id":61003068,"question_id":10723952,"last_edit_date":1586239312},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9370f57bc4a6e5af17b5e9a6ffc0531f?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG","account_id":2805226,"user_type":"registered","user_id":2412606,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2412606/happy","reputation":777,"display_name":"Happy"},"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","score":1,"is_accepted":false,"last_activity_date":1586156654,"creation_date":1571813049,"body":"<blockquote>\n  <p>How can synthetic fields be created in Java? </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><code>synthetic</code> field is created by Java compiler automatically, in some specific cases.</p>\n\n<p>Examples:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Help process the Java <code>assert</code> keyword - <a href=\"https://openjdk.binarydoc.org/net.java/openjdk/13.0/classfile?classfilelocation=java.awt.awtkeystroke\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">java.awt.AWTKeyStroke</a>.<a href=\"https://openjdk.binarydoc.org/net.java/openjdk/13.0/field?classfilelocation=java.awt.awtkeystroke&amp;seq=10&amp;fieldname=%24assertionsDisabled\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">$assertionsDisabled</a></p></li>\n<li><p>Help process the java <code>this</code> keyword - <a href=\"https://openjdk.binarydoc.org/net.java/openjdk/13.0/classfile?classfilelocation=java.util.abstractlist%24itr\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">java.util.AbstractList$Itr</a>.<a href=\"https://openjdk.binarydoc.org/net.java/openjdk/13.0/field?classfilelocation=java.util.abstractlist%24itr&amp;seq=4&amp;fieldname=this%240\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this$0</a></p></li>\n<li><p>Field in an anonymous inner class - <a href=\"https://openjdk.binarydoc.org/net.java/openjdk/13.0/classfile?classfilelocation=java.util.abstractlist%24sublist%241\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">java.util.AbstractList$SubList$1</a>.<a href=\"https://openjdk.binarydoc.org/net.java/openjdk/13.0/field?classfilelocation=java.util.abstractlist%24sublist%241&amp;seq=2&amp;fieldname=val%24index\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">val$index</a></p></li>\n<li><p>Help process on Enum fields - <a href=\"https://openjdk.binarydoc.org/net.java/openjdk/13.0/classfile?classfilelocation=java.nio.file.attribute.aclentryflag\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">java.nio.file.attribute.AclEntryFlag</a>.<a href=\"https://openjdk.binarydoc.org/net.java/openjdk/13.0/field?classfilelocation=java.nio.file.attribute.aclentryflag&amp;seq=5&amp;fieldname=%24VALUES\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">$VALUES</a></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Can synthetic fields in java only be created at runtime?

And I couldn't be happier about this!</p>\n\n<h3>The <em>naive</em> approach</h3>\n\n<p>Let's imagine that what you're trying to achieve was actually possible and a supported operation in the <code>java.lang.reflect</code>-API. What kind of information and mechanisms would be required to provide such a functionality? In case one should be able to retrieve whether a certain method has already been invoked (on a certain object) at least once at any time (with no kind of \"start delimiter\"), the Java Virtual Machine would be required to keep track of any invocation ever made; effectively forcing it to persist all stack frames ever created! Introducing such a start delimiter may possibly reduce the runtime overhead, but would still require an extremely complex form of stack frame auditing, built into every JVM. </p>\n\n<h3>How Mockito is doing it</h3>\n\n<p>But hey, Mockito is able to provide such a functionality, right? Indeed, but I think you're underestimating the complexity of the way they're doing that. </p>\n\n<p>First, there's a very important, conceptual difference between your and Mockito's approach. It already becomes apparent when taking a look at the very first example on the <a href=\"https://site.mockito.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mockito website</a>:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;\n\n// mock creation\nList mockedList = mock(List.class);\n\n// using mock object - it does not throw any \"unexpected interaction\" exception\nmockedList.add(\"one\");\nmockedList.clear();\n\n// selective, explicit, highly readable verification\nverify(mockedList).add(\"one\");\nverify(mockedList).clear();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Users of the framework always have to mock the types of interest first; either explicitly like here or in a more implicit manner by using annotations. As I'm not very familiar with the Mockito framework, there may be even more elegant ways to do so; but it all boils down to the very same concept. </p>\n\n<p>But what does \"mocking a type\" even mean and what should it be good for? Actually, Mockito has to somehow intercept any call that is being made to the object returned by the mocking method (or the other mechanisms, respectively). Fortunately (keeping the beginning of this post in mind), Mockito isn't able to do so directly, so the developers had to come up with something else: Creating new types dynamically at runtime that are not only delegating the method calls to the actual implementation, but that also keep track of the methods that are being invoked on that particular type.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at the framework's <a href=\"https://github.com/mockito/mockito\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">source code</a>, it seems like that the <em>real magic</em> is happening in the <a href=\"https://github.com/mockito/mockito/tree/release/3.x/src/main/java/org/mockito/internal/creation/bytebuddy\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>org.mockito.internal.creation.bytebuddy</code></a> package. In <a href=\"https://github.com/mockito/mockito/blob/release/3.x/src/main/java/org/mockito/internal/creation/bytebuddy/SubclassBytecodeGenerator.java\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>SubclassBytecodeGenerator</code></a>, you can find Mockito's type creation logic. As the package name already implies, Mockito uses the <a href=\"https://bytebuddy.net/#/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Byte Buddy framework</a> for the bytecode generation and loading process.</p>\n\n<h3>Library support</h3>\n\n<p>As you've also asked for a library which you may use to achieve the same behavior: As far as I can tell, there's no <em>really well-known library</em> out there. </p>\n\n<p>To be honest: I'm not surprised that that's the case. I mean, what should one use such a library for? Checking whether a method has been invoked is something one should do in tests; other use cases are quite limited. </p>\n\n<p>So, yeah. Your options are quite limited, I suppose.</p>\n","answer_id":61020356,"question_id":61014998,"last_edit_date":1586000740},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8fbe63f77ce3f9656c62b27db4d8583b?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG","account_id":785560,"user_type":"registered","user_id":845414,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/845414/johannes-kuhn","reputation":14879,"display_name":"Johannes Kuhn"},"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","score":1,"is_accepted":true,"last_activity_date":1585935806,"creation_date":1585935806,"body":"<p>If you want to get the callers Class, you can use the newish (introduced in Java 9) <a href=\"https://download.java.net/java/GA/jdk14/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/StackWalker.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>StackWalker</code></a>  API:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Foo {\n    private static final StackWalker SW = StackWalker.getInstance(StackWalker.Option.RETAIN_CLASS_REFERENCE);\n\n    public Foo() {\n        Class&lt;?&gt;

In the problem you described, setting variables based on a string i'd consider going with your hashmap idea which would reference variables via a string key which seems like exactly what you are describing. If you need the ability to reference values that do not exist you could also include factory methods to create variables when no key exists and then add to the map, if you are wrapping the objects then they will be passed by reference to avoid the problem you describe but this depends on the implementation (eg using Integer class etc for auto boxing if you are referencing primitives) Together this would allow for a much tighter and well defined implementation rather than reflecting values here there and everywhere.
