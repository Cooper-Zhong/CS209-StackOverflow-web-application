You would need <code>(T[]) new Comparable[n]</code> instead, since <code>Comparable</code> is the erasure of <code>T</code>. In the OP&#39;s case, they want to create an array of a parameterized type. The erasure of a parameterized type is just the raw type.

As spotted by Holger in the below comment, I am able to use flatmap directly instead of map+flatmap. Regarding Files.lines I understand it returns a stream&lt;String&gt; of lines which is exactly what I want for my use. Do you see any concerns/issues with that? Kindly point out, if yes.

The problem is that I don&#39;t want to specify a bound to T, as T is supposed to be generic, that is, it may or may not be a Number. If I want to use for example <code>Predicate&lt;String&gt; p = isEquals(Boolean::parseBoolean, true)</code>, then it wouldn&#39;t compile either, which is no good.

You would need <code>(T[]) new Comparable[n]</code> instead, since <code>Comparable</code> is the erasure of <code>T</code>. In the OP&#39;s case, they want to create an array of a parameterized type. The erasure of a parameterized type is just the raw type.
