I either would convert the enum into an entity, or map the enum using the standard ordinal."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9f56897ba91369ccca5cc749087ae4d5?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG&f=y&so-version=2","account_id":8490983,"user_type":"registered","user_id":6367321,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6367321/bbccccn","reputation":36,"display_name":"bbccccn"},"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","score":0,"post_id":64883976,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/234d450e0f4554acb818930ba5921524?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG","account_id":2408521,"user_type":"registered","user_id":2104280,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2104280/jan-willem-gmelig-meyling","reputation":3724,"display_name":"Jan-Willem Gmelig Meyling","accept_rate":78},"edited":false,"creation_date":1605716070,"comment_id":114737868,"body":"JPA.

For this reason it is a good practice to build image for specific profiles (development, production, etc.)."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ad03c1993d5a8491c44f242bfa9625a0?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG&f=y&so-version=2","account_id":12579106,"user_type":"registered","user_id":9150474,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9150474/rhh","reputation":41,"display_name":"RHH"},"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","score":0,"post_id":55472628,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f3e626e9e8b8e7c6b3370216d745d212?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG&f=y&so-version=2","account_id":7629418,"user_type":"registered","user_id":5784959,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5784959/runefist","reputation":583,"display_name":"runefist","accept_rate":50},"edited":false,"creation_date":1554202063,"comment_id":97656251,"body":"yes I&#39;ve got time, I&#39;ll give it a shot and try do it using a map but would be very grateful to see your code"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f3e626e9e8b8e7c6b3370216d745d212?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG&f=y&so-version=2","account_id":7629418,"user_type":"registered","user_id":5784959,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5784959/runefist","reputation":583,"display_name":"runefist","accept_rate":50},"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","score":0,"post_id":55472628,"edited":false,"creation_date":1554201919,"comment_id":97656158,"body":"Might want to store it in an object that has a map Map&lt;String, String&gt; and make your own sort method of the object.

That&#39;s one of the things that makes multithreading more difficult."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8283c64511fa80afed5259d10850168f?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG&f=y&so-version=2","account_id":7612423,"user_type":"registered","user_id":5772882,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5772882/anonymous","reputation":82466,"display_name":"Anonymous"},"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","score":1,"post_id":3778202,"edited":false,"creation_date":1517316596,"comment_id":84038260,"body":"Modern way: <code>OffsetDateTime.parse(&quot;2010-07-26T11:37:52Z&quot;).format(DateTime&zwnj;&#8203;Formatter.ofPattern(&zwnj;&#8203;&quot;dd-MMM-uuuu&quot;))</code>."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-QS1ZRAr6eo4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAM4/eHfWnhFH7EU/photo.jpg?sz=256","account_id":9778298,"user_type":"registered","user_id":7247403,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7247403/vaishnavi-manjunath","reputation":31,"display_name":"Vaishnavi Manjunath","accept_rate":0},"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","score":1,"post_id":46704786,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/89f6272aa65ac53175d7c214d57ad1be?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG&f=y&so-version=2","account_id":3175948,"user_type":"registered","user_id":2683814,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2683814/s7vr","reputation":74316,"display_name":"s7vr","accept_rate":100},"edited":false,"creation_date":1507861725,"comment_id":80389826,"body":"I tried the  solutions mentioned in this, but in vain."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/89f6272aa65ac53175d7c214d57ad1be?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG&f=y&so-version=2","account_id":3175948,"user_type":"registered","user_id":2683814,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2683814/s7vr","reputation":74316,"display_name":"s7vr","accept_rate":100},"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","score":0,"post_id":46704786,"edited":false,"creation_date":1507814765,"comment_id":80368005,"body":"Possible duplicate of <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45214057/what-is-the-correct-way-to-use-operators-in-mongo-aggregation-pipelines-with-mor\">What is the correct way to use operators in Mongo aggregation pipelines with Morphia</a>"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ffbf4e85b8ffbae4e9039b9c0cf07bc8?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG","account_id":2496,"user_type":"registered","user_id":3474,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3474/erickson","reputation":266224,"display_name":"erickson","accept_rate":83},"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","score":0,"post_id":43459993,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3f265dbe3edef5d671947a604f7171bf?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG&f=y&so-version=2","account_id":3421244,"user_type":"registered","user_id":2868801,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2868801/dave-thompson-085","reputation":35853,"display_name":"dave_thompson_085"},"edited":false,"creation_date":1492472329,"comment_id":73978427,"body":"@dave_thompson_085 Sure, but the example in the comment is PKCS #1.

I recommend you look into that one, as it is more efficient that odd-even sort."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f72351c9d835bb9b07d65c61201fbe04?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG&f=y&so-version=2","account_id":12360572,"user_type":"registered","user_id":9014957,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9014957/pburgr","reputation":1730,"display_name":"pburgr","accept_rate":17},"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","score":0,"post_id":72224909,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhUFIg5r5u4z6CTyOFjwNbhfLSKcgMVJnOY2p9wig=k-s256","account_id":21962722,"user_type":"registered","user_id":16240401,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/16240401/selda-bozkurt","reputation":11,"display_name":"selda bozkurt"},"edited":false,"creation_date":1652704951,"comment_id":127662910,"body":"@seldabozkurt pls mark the answer as useful ;-)"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tHfIs.jpg?s=256&g=1","account_id":23676412,"user_type":"registered","user_id":17702591,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/17702591/used-to-love","reputation":21,"display_name":"Used To Love"},"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","score":0,"post_id":72227570,"edited":false,"creation_date":1652699845,"comment_id":127661193,"body":"I tried several times and I seems to got the knack, suppose you create a folder &quot;java/&quot; to store all your projects, then if you set this folder as workspace, the extension won&#39;t recognize when you create new project in this folder, but this approach works: open vscode and open a project in &quot;java/&quot;(suppose you hava create one),then create new projects in &quot;java/&quot; it will work, by the time, I notice the workspace name has changed to &quot;untitled&quot;."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9cddc6d3d0e4aaf4c85964ad82cea009?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG","account_id":24435058,"user_type":"registered","user_id":18359438,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/18359438/mingjie-msft","reputation":6292,"display_name":"MingJie-MSFT"},"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","score":0,"post_id":72227570,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tHfIs.jpg?s=256&g=1","account_id":23676412,"user_type":"registered","user_id":17702591,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/17702591/used-to-love","reputation":21,"display_name":"Used To Love"},"edited":false,"creation_date":1652685169,"comment_id":127656501,"body":"Let me answer your previous question first.

Also, why does the server need to sign my CSR?"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UNUZ7rj93s8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACns/tJZgK0hXyPg/photo.jpg?sz=256","account_id":9922942,"user_type":"registered","user_id":7345493,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7345493/innovationchef","reputation":348,"display_name":"Innovationchef"},"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","score":1,"post_id":66357210,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1c3b0413d0781c639df07166ab10cad3?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG&f=y&so-version=2","account_id":19719372,"user_type":"registered","user_id":14438087,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/14438087/djangodev1","reputation":242,"display_name":"DjangoDev1"},"edited":false,"creation_date":1614197953,"comment_id":117315698,"body":"&quot;So, I now need to send put the certificate in SSLContext and with that I&#39;ll prove that I actually own the certificate ?&quot; -&gt; So, I now need to &quot;put&quot; the &quot;private&quot; certificate in SSLContext and with that I&#39;ll prove that I actually &quot;am a verified client to the rest service provider&quot;?
