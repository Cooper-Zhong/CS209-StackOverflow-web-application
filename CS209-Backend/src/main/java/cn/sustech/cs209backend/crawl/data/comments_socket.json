The sockets are not the same objects. They&#39;re two instances of the same class. One runs in the server JVM, the other one in the client JVM. And the whole point of sockets is to communicate between processes over the network: the client connects to the server, and then the two sockets are connected to each other, and allow sending/receiving date.
